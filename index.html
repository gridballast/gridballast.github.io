	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>GridBallast is a research project funded by <a href='https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=programs/nodes'>ARPA-E</a> and led by <a href='https://www.electric.coop'>NRECA</a>, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. It has developed low cost control devices for water heaters and  circuit panels that can operate autonomously to improve the stability and resilience of the North American electric grid.  Project partners include <a href='https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/'>Carnegie Mellon University</a> (CMU), <a href='https://www.eaton.com/EatonCA/ProductsSolutions/Electrical/MarketSolutions/SmartGrid/index.htm'>Eaton</a>, and <a href='http://www.sparkmeter.io'>SparkMeter.</a>
	<h1>Hardware</h1>
	The GridBallast controllers measure grid frequency and voltage locally and control the loads to fix deviations from safe operating limits. An open source controller hardware platform shown below has been developed at CMU. A water heater controller has been developed at Eaton, and a circuit panel controller has been developed at SparkMeter.

	<h1>Simulation</h1>
	Before testing in the laboratory and the field, we ran simulations to prove the safety and effectiveness of the controls. Results across multiple utilities show that the controls reduce voltage and violations even in environments with heavy rooftop solar penetration. Simulations were built on top of the <a href="https://omf.coop">Open Modeling Framework</a>, an open source electric grid modeling platform (shown below in screenshots and a video walkthrough). A more detailed report on the simulation results is also available.
